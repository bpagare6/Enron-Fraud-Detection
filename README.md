# EnronFraudDetection

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. Here, I build a supervised learning algorithm to identify fraudulent employees using Enron dataset.

## Description

The Enron fraud is the largest case of corporate fraud in American history. Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation went bankrupt by end of 2001 due to widespread corporate fraud and corruption. Before its fall, Fortune magazine had named Enron "America's most innovative company" for six consecutive years. So what happened? Who were the culprits?

In this project, I have played role of detective and built a classification algorithm to predict a person of interest identifier (POI) based on email and financial features in the combined dataset. A POI is anyone who has been indicted, settled without admitting the guilt and testified in exchange for immunity. We will check our predicted POI against actual POI in the dataset to evaluate our prediction.

Here I have followed the 4 major steps of any Machine Learning Project,
1. Dataset and Question Building
2. Feature Engineering and Selection
3. Model Building
4. Evaluation of Model

## Dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Motivation

As it was one of biggest corporate fraud, that inspired me to analyze this data and create a classification algorithm to identify the POIs
